# IreNFist
A comprehensive rebalance mod for PAYDAY 2, which rebalances weapons, enemies, and even assault squads. This is a fork of the original IreNFist mod by Solo Queue Pixy, which was discontinued.	
This fork was updated to include the newest DLC weapons and weapon mods, and full VR compatibility has been added. Assaults were also tweaked (re-added shotgunners and hostage rescue teams).	

For VR users, the [VR Recoil mod](https://github.com/HugoZink/PD2VRRecoil) is strongly recommended. Recoil is a big part of weapon balance in IreNFist.
